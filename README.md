# armor_stand_editor
Minecraft datapack for making miniature versions of blocks

Important!
Some of the functions are internal, like copy_block, so read this so you know how to use it

How to use: 
Stand at the corner of your building, facing SouthEast.
Then run this function:
/function armor_stand_editor:copy_cube
Or, for an even smaller version run this function:
/function armor_stand_editor:copy_cube


Change the dimensions of the targeted zone like this:
/scoreboard players set X mb_dimensions 5

Dimensions default to 7 every time you reload. High numbers can create lag.
